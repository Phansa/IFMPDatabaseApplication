# IFMPDatabaseApplication
Source code for the Database Application I wrote for this non profit organization. 
The organization has moved on to using a web based solution for their database management, but 
this was used from August 2015 - December 2016. As one of my first big projects I worked on
I learned a lot about software and coding in general from working on it!


The flow of the application goes form3 -> form2 (Login vertification) -> form1 (Main datagridview of the
contents of the database). From here a User can go to the add member page if they would like to add
a new member to the members database or go to settings and add various properties to other databases.
There is a resize prompt that launches on startup that allows you to choose the size
of the application as well.
