# IFMPDatabaseApplication
Source code for the Database Application I wrote for this non profit organization. 
The organization has moved on to using a web based solution for their database management, but 
this was used from August 2015 - December 2016. As one of my first big projects I worked on
I learned a lot about software and coding in general from working on it!
